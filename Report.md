Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Report
Overview
This report details the data cleaning and preprocessing steps performed on the student dataset (bi.csv). The dataset contains information about students, including demographic and academic performance metrics. The goal was to clean the data to ensure consistency, handle missing values, and address outliers for reliable analysis.

Part 1 – Data Cleaning
Dataset Structure
Shape: The dataset originally had 77 rows and 11 columns.

Data Types: Mixed data types included objects (categorical) and numerical (int64, float64).

Inconsistencies Found and Fixed
1. Gender Column
Inconsistencies: Values included 'Female', 'M', 'Male', 'F', 'female', 'male'.

Fix: Standardized to 'F' and 'M' using .replace().

2. Country Column
Inconsistencies: 'norway', 'Norge', and 'Rsa' were inconsistent with 'Norway' and 'South Africa'.

Fix: Replaced 'norway' and 'Norge' with 'Norway', and 'Rsa' with 'South Africa'.

3. prevEducation Column
Inconsistencies: Varied spellings like 'Diplomaaa', 'diploma', 'DIPLOMA', 'High School', and 'Barrrchelors'.

Fix: Standardized to 'Diploma', 'HighSchool', and 'Bachelors'.

Duplicates
Check: No duplicates were found (df.duplicated().sum() returned 0).

Part 2 – Missing Data
Missing Values Identified
Python Column: 2 missing values.

Other Columns: No missing values.

Imputation Strategy
Method: Used median imputation for the Python column.

Reason: The median is robust to outliers and preserves the central tendency of the score distribution.

Part 3 – Outliers
Outlier Detection
Method: Used boxplots and summary statistics to identify outliers in studyHOURS.

Findings: Some values were unrealistically low (e.g., 114, 120, 122) compared to the median (156).

Outlier Handling
Method: Applied the IQR method via datasist.structdata.detect_outliers().

Action: Replaced outliers in studyHOURS with the column median (156).

Deliverables
Cleaned Dataset
Saved as cleaned_data.csv.

Contains standardized categories, no missing values, and mitigated outliers.

Key Changes Summary
Standardized Categories: Gender, country, and education levels are now consistent.

Missing Values: Imputed Python scores using the median.

Outliers: Replaced extreme studyHOURS values with the median.

The cleaned dataset is now ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning tasks.

Tools Used
Python Libraries: pandas, seaborn, datasist

Visualization: Boxplots for outlier detection

Imputation: Median for numerical missing values

This cleaning process ensures the dataset is reliable, consistent, and suitable for further analysis.
